# Rockem Munchem

## Purpose
Rockem Munchem was created during an 8 hour indie game development jam. The premise was to create any web game from scratch in a language of our choice within an 8 hour window. At the time in my education, I was primarily self taught, and wanted to see if I could create a Javascript game to exercise what I had been learning online.

## How to Play
To begin, you can start by clicking on different rocks to mine and collect them. With enough minerals, you can purchase upgrades and increase the amount of ore you can mine in a short amount of time.
